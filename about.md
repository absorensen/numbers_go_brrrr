# About
All of the text on this website was written by me, Anders. I come from a computer graphics background, but used to work at an AI research center as a "compute guy".
Then I went back to computer graphics, making high performance renderers.
While working at this AI research center, we (management and I) found a lack of learning material for *data science*-ish people. Not necessarily making them
masters of performance optimization, but enough to know the basics, when something is wrong and how to communicate their issues to someone who can help them.
Hopefully, you, the reader, will also find that these concepts can be super fun and attainable!

This project was conceptualized with Professor Lars Kai Hansen and Nicki Skafte Detlefsen while I worked at the Technical University
of Denmark and the Pioneer Centre for AI. Almost a year of work on this website was financed by the [Pioneer Centre for AI][0].
