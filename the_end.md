# The End

In the very beginning of this guide, I presented you with some performance gobbledigook, which you may or may
not have understood. What about now?

If I have more time in the future, I would like to add more profiling of the code and analyze it in expandable
sections. This would hopefully elaborate on some of the results, like access patterns, with metrics like
cache hits/misses and branch mispredictions.

Where to from here?
