# FAQ

Well, maybe not frequently, but asked... or potentially asked.

## Why is 350/3.50 or 42 used everywhere?

Either you get it or you don't. *

??? note "Answer"

    Just kidding. I don't wanna gatekeep. 42/* is from The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series.
    Treefiddy is from a South Park episode, where the Loch Ness monster always shows up to ask for
    3.50$. The meme itself is from the game God of War (2018), which then makes a reference to the
    South Park episode through God of War due to the similarity of the World Serpent and the
    Loch Ness monster. All of these things are excellent.
