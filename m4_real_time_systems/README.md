# Real-Time Systems
Now we've assembled some conceptual tools for you to use and we're ready to look at things from a more
systems-oriented point of view. The rest of this module will be describing some of the practical glue to tie
things together that are neither here nor there. Interactions, user interfaces, architecture and design,
logging and the like. I won't be going into as much detail as the other sections, but it should be enough
to fill out some blanks you might not normally be thinking of.
