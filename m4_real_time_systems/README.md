# Real-Time Systems
Now we've assembled some tools for you to use and we're ready to put them together in a project.
The rest of this module will be describing some of the practical glue to tie things together. Interactions,
user interfaces, architecture and design, logging and the like. I won't be going into as much detail as the other
sections, but it should be enough to steer you in a systems direction.
