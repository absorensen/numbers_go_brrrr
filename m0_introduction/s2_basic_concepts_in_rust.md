# Basic Concepts in Rust
This section is a barebones introduction to concepts in Rust which you will need to
understand in order to read the guide's code. If you would like a more thorough introduction to Rust, there is
a number of [nice tutorials][0] available.

The real contents of this section is the project in [m0_introduction::code::basic_concepts][1].
Go into the file corresponding to each function being called in the ```main``` function in ```main.rs```
and read all of the comments in order.
